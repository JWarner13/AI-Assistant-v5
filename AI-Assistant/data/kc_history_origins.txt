
# Kansas City, Missouri: Historical Fun Facts and Origins

## The Name Game

### Why "Kansas" City is in Missouri
Kansas City, Missouri was incorporated in 1850, a full 11 years before Kansas even became a state in 1861. The city was named after the Kansas River (also called the Kaw River), which was itself named after the Kansa Native American tribe. The Missouri city came first, and Kansas City, Kansas wasn't incorporated until 1872, making it the younger sibling despite what many assume.

### The Town of Kansas
The city was originally called the "Town of Kansas" when it was founded in 1838. It was renamed Kansas City in 1889 to distinguish it from the state of Kansas and to sound more metropolitan. Before that, it was also briefly known as the "City of Kansas" from 1853 to 1889.

### Westport's Role
Before Kansas City proper existed, Westport (now a neighborhood) was the main settlement, founded in 1833 by John Calvin McCoy. It served as the final supply point for wagon trains heading out on the Santa Fe, California, and Oregon trails. Westport was an independent city until Kansas City annexed it in 1897.

## Founding Fathers and Early Days

### The Father of Kansas City
John Calvin McCoy is considered the "Father of Kansas City." He not only founded Westport but also laid out the original town of Kansas in 1838. He chose the location specifically because it was the natural rock landing on the Missouri River, perfect for steamboat traffic.

### The Great Border War
During the Civil War era, Kansas City was right on the Kansas-Missouri border during "Bleeding Kansas" - the violent confrontations between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces. The city changed hands several times during the war and was the site of the Battle of Westport in 1864, sometimes called the "Gettysburg of the West."

### Order No. 11
In 1863, Union General Thomas Ewing issued General Order No. 11, which forced the evacuation of rural areas in four Missouri counties, including Jackson County where Kansas City is located. This devastating order displaced thousands of residents and led to the burning of most rural homes and farms in the area.

## Prohibition Era Peculiarities

### The Wettest City in America
During Prohibition (1920-1933), Kansas City was known as one of the "wettest" cities in the country, meaning alcohol flowed freely despite being illegal. Under the political machine of Tom Pendergast, the city had over 300 speakeasies and jazz clubs operating openly.

### The Pendergast Machine
Tom "Boss Tom" Pendergast ran Kansas City's political machine from 1925 to 1939. His organization was so powerful that he hand-picked Harry S. Truman for the U.S. Senate in 1934. Pendergast's machine controlled everything from garbage collection to police appointments, and his influence made Kansas City a haven for jazz, gambling, and bootlegging.

### Underground Tunnels
Rumor has it that an extensive network of underground tunnels connected various speakeasies and illegal gambling establishments during Prohibition. While some utility tunnels did exist, the extent of the "secret" tunnel system has been greatly mythologized over the years.

## Presidential Connections

### Harry S. Truman
The 33rd President of the United States got his political start in Kansas City. Before becoming president, Truman:
- Worked as a haberdasher (men's clothing store owner) at 104 West 12th Street
- Served as a Jackson County judge (an administrative, not judicial position)
- His store failed in 1922, and he didn't pay off the debts until he became a U.S. Senator
- The Truman Home in Independence (a KC suburb) is now a National Historic Site

### Presidential Visits
Kansas City has hosted every president from Theodore Roosevelt to Joe Biden, except for Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan (who served before the city's prominence). The city was particularly important during the railroad era as a major stop for presidential campaign trains.

## Walt Disney's KC Connection

### Laugh-O-Gram Studios
Walt Disney founded his first animation company, Laugh-O-Gram Studios, in Kansas City in 1921 at 1127 East 31st Street. The company went bankrupt in 1923, prompting Disney to move to Hollywood. The building still stands today and has been renovated as "Thank You, Walt Disney, Inc."

### Mickey Mouse's Conception
Mickey Mouse was reportedly conceived on a train ride from New York back to Kansas City in 1928, after Disney lost the rights to his first character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Disney claimed he was inspired by a pet mouse he had while working in his KC studio.

### Disney's First Employees
Several Kansas City residents became Disney's first animators and followed him to California, including Ub Iwerks (who actually drew the first Mickey Mouse cartoons), Rudolf Ising, and Hugh Harman.

## The Great Flood of 1951

### Devastating Disaster
The flood of July 1951 was the second-worst flood in Kansas City history, causing $250 million in damages (about $2.8 billion in today's dollars). The flood killed 17 people and displaced 200,000 residents.

### Industrial Impact
The flood destroyed the city's stockyards and packing plants in the West Bottoms, accelerating the decline of KC's meatpacking industry. It also wiped out the city's original Municipal Airport, leading to the construction of what would become KCI Airport.

### Engineering Marvel Response
The disaster led to massive flood control projects, including the construction of Tuttle Creek Dam in Kansas and Smithville Lake Dam in Missouri, making Kansas City one of the most flood-protected major cities in America today.

## Unique Historical Quirks

### More Boulevards Than Paris
Kansas City has more boulevards than any city except Paris, France. The city boasts more than 135 miles of boulevards and parkways, thanks to the "City Beautiful" movement and landscape architect George Kessler's 1893 park and boulevard plan.

### The First Shopping Center
Country Club Plaza, opened in 1923, was the first shopping center in the world designed to accommodate shoppers arriving by automobile. It was the first suburban shopping district in the United States and served as a model for shopping centers nationwide.

### Hallmark's Hometown
Joyce Hall founded Hallmark Cards in Kansas City in 1910, starting by selling postcards out of two shoeboxes. The company invented modern gift wrap in 1917 when they ran out of tissue paper at Christmas and substituted decorative envelope lining papers. Hallmark remains headquartered in Kansas City and is still family-owned.

## Civil War Firsts

### First Battle of the Civil War (Arguably)
The Battle of Boonville (June 17, 1861) in Missouri is considered by some historians to be the first organized land action of the Civil War, predating the First Battle of Bull Run by over a month.

### Jesse James Origins
The notorious outlaw Jesse James was from the Kansas City area (born in nearby Kearney, Missouri). His criminal career began as a Confederate guerrilla during the Civil War. His childhood home is now a museum, complete with the original bullet hole from a Pinkerton raid.

## Architectural Innovations

### The First Mall Art Museum
The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, opened in 1933, was one of the first museums in the country to be built in a suburban/mall-like setting with extensive grounds, rather than in a dense urban core. Its massive lawn with the famous Shuttlecocks sculpture has become an iconic KC image.

### Union Station
When it opened in 1914, Union Station was the third-largest train station in the country. It could handle 250 trains daily and had the country's first Fred Harvey restaurant. After declining with the railroads, it was beautifully restored and reopened in 1999 as a cultural center.

### The Liberty Memorial
The Liberty Memorial, dedicated in 1926, is the United States' official World War I memorial and museum. At its dedication, it was the only time in history that the five Allied commanders from WWI were together in one place: Belgium's King Albert, Britain's Admiral Beatty, Italy's General Diaz, France's Marshal Foch, and America's General Pershing.
